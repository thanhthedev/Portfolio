### Target audience
Potential employers and teachers.

### Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
Used HTML, CSS and Github.  
## Design documentation

### Design process
1. Looked at other portfolios on the internet to get ideas.
2. Started looking at wireframes.
3. Started looking at sites to find icons. Decided going with fontawesome.com
4. Started looking at sites that can create logos for free. Went with logomkr.com
5. Didn't want to overestimate my abilities so i decided to go with a simple design instead of more complex design and risk not being completed in time. Also because this was my first portfolio.

### Wireframes

### Personal logo (optional)

### Usability considerations
Thought about adding a navigation bar but thought it was pointless because it was just one page. Also thought about adding a "back to the top" button but decided it was also pointless since it requires some javascript which i haven't yet learned and my portfolio page isnt very long. Made it responsive for just phones because it still looked good in tablets and desktops.

## Domains, Web Servers, DNS and Web Browsers
Domains are used to identify one or more IP Addresses. The Domain Naming System (DNS) is like a phone book for the internet. It keeps track of website names and links them to IP Addresses.
Webservers are computers that stores websites so that people can visit them on the internet. Web Browsers such as Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox read these files and converts them into texts and images for you to view. 

## Internet Technologies Email
Email has changed the way we write to each other. Before email we had to send letters to a person through the post office which may take days to receive. Now we can open up a email service provder such as Gmail or Hotmail and send an email to a person and they receive it almost instantaneously. The cost of an email is free whereas sending a letter incurs some cost such as stamps.
